# SilkBoard

An open-source collaborative whiteboard built at FOSSHack 2025!

SilkBoard is a fully open-source collaborative whiteboard, built to offer a free and transparent alternative to proprietary tools like Miro, Jamboard, and FigJam. Unlike closed platforms that lock users into ecosystems, SilkBoard gives you complete control over your data, customization, and hosting. With real-time collaboration, an intuitive drawing interface, and extensibility through open contributions, teams, educators, and creators can work without limits. No subscriptions, no paywallsâ€”just pure, unrestricted collaboration.
